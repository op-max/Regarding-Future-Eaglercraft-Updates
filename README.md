# Regarding-Future-Eaglercraft-Updates
As you might know- I'm a big eaglercraft lover who goes by the username, Person_A.
Eaglercraft is a truly amazing feat to give minecraft via browser or download on low-end hardware such as school chromebooks.

Made by lax1dude and support with ayunami2000, Eaglercraft came from a buggy beta 1.3 release and 1.5.2 minecraft to 1.8.9
My point is I believe Eaglercraft will fall short and be stuck at 1.8.9 and will probably never go into EaglecraftY (1.9)
Well you may think 'but lax1dude did the virtual impossible surely 1.9 can come out' 
# Why Eaglercraft 1.9 won't come out
1. Through stages 1.9-1.13, game playability lower the already struggling fps and ping of the gameplay. In order for it to run smoothly, you might as well rewrite the code which I believe no one wants to do.
2. If you search up 'EaglercraftY' or 'Eaglercraft 1.9' many results will show up which contain blank repositories or read.md supposing it to come out.
3. Mojang has already noticed since the middle stage of 1.5.2 the popularity and the money they lose due to people playing on eaglercraft. Due to this, they set up DMCA's and potentially get into court. This is probably the reason for the lack of content from lax1dude for he had to deal with this. Honestly, I don't think anyone wants to take a stand against a multi-billion dollar company.
# Now you can see my view- it's up to you yourself to think whether EaglercraftY is coming up
